#### TODO

* TextureImageTileScroll should always be scrolling a bit
* Set audio level between tracks for DJ set


* Share buffers for textures since they chug when lazy-initializing new ones??

* Specific texture improvements:
	* shader: star-trails.glsl	- also any shader that gets really off with ultra-widescreen. aspect ratio correctino isn't working right
	* TextureStarTrails - needs more audio
* Add new visuals
* get videos for top layer or other layers - thematic stuff!
* add multiple audio textures before other drawing & store into AppStore - use these for colorizing shader
* Add legit text layer



* Add effects/displacement automation for auto-pilot - abstract occasional knob turn?
* Add in texture layer effects decisions

* Add more effects
* Add MIDI controls for swapping out individual layers
