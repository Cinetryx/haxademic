# Haxademic

Haxademic is my personal Processing-based creative coding toolkit, built to run in Eclipse with Java and the latest version of [Processing](http://processing.org/). It's a starting point for interactive visuals, rendering and desktop/installation apps. It requires several essential Java/Processing libraries and wraps them up to play nicely with each other.

## State of affairs
While the code has been open-sourced, I don't plan on making it easy/viable for others to use. This repository is more about sharing the interesting code within, and I fully endorse borrowing it however you see fit.

## Dependencies

Haxademic uses the following Java & Processing libraries, which I've included in this repository so you don't have to find them yourself (more on that below):

## Licensing

The Haxademic codebase and apps are [MIT licensed](https://raw.github.com/cacheflowe/haxademic/master/LICENSE), so do what you want with these files. Feel free to let me know that you're using it for something cool. I've added 3rd-party .jar files and compiled Java libraries that I'm probably not actually allowed to redistribute here, so if you're the owner of one of those libraries and would like the files removed, let me know. I've included them to aid those who would like a quick start and not have to search for the many dependencies of this project. Some of these libraries have disappeared from the web entirely, so searching for them may be futile anyway. I just want people to make cool things with this library, and hope you understand.
